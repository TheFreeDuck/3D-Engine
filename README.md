# 3d-Engine
A simple 3D engine with online multiplayer made in java.

## Common issues
### Rotation
+ looking up and down warps the image
+ rotating on multiple axis warps the image
+ rotation seems to be dependent on the distance from the origin

### Clipping
+ The edges are getting cliped before the go behind the observer beacuse it doesnt work otherwise for some reason
+ sometimes the edges clip incorrectly and go acroes the entire screen.

### Multiplayer
+ a lot of issues
